Pelvic floor physical therapy has gained more attention in recent years, but there are still many misconceptions about what it is and who it's for. Let's debunk some of the most common myths.

## Myth 1: It's Only for Women Who've Had Babies

While postpartum women often benefit from pelvic floor PT, it's not just for new moms. Athletes, women going through menopause, anyone with bladder issues, pelvic pain, or sexual dysfunction can benefit from treatment.

## Myth 2: You Just Do Kegels

Kegels are just one small piece of the puzzle, and they're not right for everyone. In fact, if your pelvic floor muscles are too tight, Kegels can make things worse. A thorough evaluation helps determine what you actually need.

## Myth 3: It's Embarrassing and Invasive

I understand this concern, but your comfort is always the priority. While internal examination can provide valuable information, it's never required. We can accomplish a lot through external work and education.

## Myth 4: Leaking is Normal After Having Kids

Leaking might be common, but that doesn't make it normal or something you just have to live with. Pelvic floor PT can help you regain control and stop relying on pads.

## Myth 5: You Have to Get a Referral

In Maryland, you can see a physical therapist directly without a doctor's referral. This is called direct access, and it can help you get treatment faster.

## The Bottom Line

Pelvic floor physical therapy is a specialized, evidence-based treatment that can help with a wide range of conditions. If you've been putting it off because of any of these myths, I encourage you to reach out and learn more about how it might help you.
